# Ensure Gazebo env variables are set
#
# See https://gazebosim.org/tutorials?tut=components#EnvironmentVariables
# > If you want to modify Gazebo's behavior, e.g., by extending the path it searches for models,
#   you should first source the shell script listed above, then modify the variables that it sets.
#
# The /usr/share/gazebo/setup.bash is NOT sourced automatically.
#
# Our custom paths are added using the gazebo_ros_paths.py script (which is a part of gazebo_ros package).
# In order to ensure correct working we need to source /usr/share/gazebo/setup.bash first.
# See also https://github.com/ros-simulation/gazebo_ros_pkgs/wiki/ROS-2-Migration:-Gazebo-ROS-Paths.

# TODO: support different gazebo locations (detect it?)
